# budding-belly-buttons
Flask-Plotly app

This project uses Flask, SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Plotly.js to visualize data from the belly button project, looking at the distribution of types of bacteria in volunteers navels.

The app was developed locally and [deployed to Heroku](https://budding-belly-buttons.herokuapp.com/).

The project was an exercise to develop D3 and Plotly skills in Javascript, using a provided SQLite and API endpoints generated via Flask/SQLAlchemy.

The front end was styled with Bootstrap components, including a dynamic drop down list to select a sample and display its bacterial populations.
